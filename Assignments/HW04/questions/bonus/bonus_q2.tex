	Given \( F_1 = \prod M(0, 4, 5, 6) \) and \( F_2 = \prod M(0, 3, 4, 6, 7) \), find the maxterm expansion for \( F_1 F_2 \). State a general rule for finding the maxterm expansion of \( F_1 F_2 \) given the maxterm expansion of \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \). Prove your answer by using the general form of the maxterm expansion.
